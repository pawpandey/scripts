_A desktop notification_<br>
![Notification](http://i.imgur.com/3DuQj9n.png)


0. select area of your screen
0. The screenshot is uploaded to [imgur](https://imgur.com)


Features
----
* You can edit the screenshot with any program _(GUI or CLI)_ before uploading
* The link can be copied to clipboard
* Normal image files can be uploaded, too
* Upload anonymous or to your imgur account
* You can open the URL or file with any program _(browser, image viewer)_ after upload
* The screenshot can be saved or deleted from disk
* All filenames + URLs (and errors) are logged
* The program can check for updates

The edit feature is very interesting for automization with something like [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php), or to add notes with a GUI editor.

Installation
----

Check if you have all dependencies installed:

```Bash
imgur-screenshot --check
```

That's it. You can bind the script to a hotkey or add it (or a symlink) to your $PATH for quick access ;)

**Enjoy!**

Usage
----
```bash
imgur-screenshot [--connect | --check | -v ] | [[-e | --edit=true|false] [-l | --login=true|false] [file]]
```

* `--connect` Connect to your imgur account, exit
* `--check` Check if all dependencies are installed, exit
* `-v` Print current version, exit
* `--edit=true|false` override _edit_ config (_-e_ is _--edit=true_)
* `--login=true|false` override _login_ config (_-l_ is _--login=true_)
* `file` instead of uploading a screenshot, upload `file`

### Uploading a screenshot

All you need to do is simply run `imgur-screenshot`.

### Uploading a screenshot to your account

```bash
imgur-screenshot --connect # shows you which account you're connected to
imgur-screenshot -l
```

This will not work on Windows. (maybe with cygwin?)<br>
I have successfully tested this on Ubuntu and OS X.<br>
If this won't work on your OS, [create a new issue](https://github.com/jomo/imgur-screenshot/issues/new?title=add+support+for+_______&body=required+steps+to+make+it+work+on+______:).

Note
----

The screenshot will be taken **after** the selection has been made. This could be annoying if you want to capture something quickly and _then_ want to select an area. I might implement this as a FutureFeatureâ„¢ when I find a decent way to capture the whole screen, display the shot in full screen and then crop it to a selection.

Troubleshooting
----

If you get a notification like

> **Something went wrong :(<br>**
> Information logged to /foo/bar/logfile.log

This probably means that `scrot -s`/`screencapture -s` was unable to make a selective screenshot.

* You pressed the <kbd>any</kbd> key during selection
* (Linux) `sleep 0.1` in the script didn't help. Try increasing the value
* You don't have permission to write the file
* One of the dependencies is not installed
* You don't have your display plugged in (wrong terminal?) >_<
* ?? - run `scrot -s`/`screencapture -s` directly and check the outcome
